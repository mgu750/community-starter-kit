### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: shows apps still needing development
- **qa-needed**: shows apps needing review for quality assurance
- **documentation-needed**: shows apps lacking documentation
- **bug-high-priority**: shows apps with detrimental bugs in need of rapid repair for the app to work properly
- **bug-low-priority**: shows apps with bugs in need of eventual repair but that do not majorly inhibit functionality
- **help-wanted**: shows apps in need of contributions

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
